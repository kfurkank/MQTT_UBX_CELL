 * @transportcallback
 * @brief Transport interface for receiving data on the network.
 *
 * @note It is RECOMMENDED that the transport receive implementation
 * does NOT block when requested to read a single byte. A single byte
 * read request can be made by the caller to check whether there is a
 * new frame available on the network for reading.
 * However, the receive implementation MAY block for a timeout period when
 * it is requested to read more than 1 byte. This is because once the caller
 * is aware that a new frame is available to read on the network, then
 * the likelihood of reading more than one byte over the network becomes high.
 *
 * @param[in] pNetworkContext Implementation-defined network context.
 * @param[in] pBuffer Buffer to receive the data into.
 * @param[in] bytesToRecv Number of bytes requested from the network.
 *
 * @return The number of bytes received or a negative value to indicate
 * error.
 *
 * @note If no data is available on the network to read and no error
 * has occurred, zero MUST be the return value. A zero return value
 * SHOULD represent that the read operation can be retried by calling
 * the API function. Zero MUST NOT be returned if a network disconnection
 * has occurred.
